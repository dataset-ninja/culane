**CULane Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 14250 images with 43210 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *lane 2*, *lane 3*, *lane 1*, and other: *lane 4*.

Images in the CULane Dataset dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 1233 (9% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *train* (14250 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 9 challenging categories: ***normal*** (0 instances), ***crowd*** (0 instances), ***hlight*** (0 instances), ***shadow*** (0 instances), ***noline*** (0 instances), ***arrow*** (0 instances), ***curve*** (0 instances), ***cross*** (0 instances), and ***night*** (0 instances). Additionally, every image marked with its ***sequence*** tag.
